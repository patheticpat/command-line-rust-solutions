# command-line-rust-solutions
This repo contains my solutions for [Command-Line Rust](https://github.com/kyclark/command-line-rust.git) by Ken Youens-Clark.

## Running the tests
In order to run all included tests from the book, execute
```console
foo@bar:~$ cargo test
```
from the root of the workspace.
